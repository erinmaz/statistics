Yes, there are so many existing OERs (open-educational resources) for statistics, but there is always room for one more. Source code for everything available in the respective repos.

## We are remixing, editing, revising, these amazing resources:

1. Matthew Crump's book "Answering Questions with Data": [https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/)

2. Danielle Navarro's "Learning Statistics with R" [https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/)

3. We are adding our own stuff too! 

## Project notes

We adopted this OER in the winter semester of 2021, with updates continuously from that point.

1. The OER is written in Rmarkdown, using the bookdown package. All of the source code for compiling the book is in this repo.
